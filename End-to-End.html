    <h1>End-to-End Culture Design</h1>
        <p>More engaged organizations consistently outperform their competitors.</p>
        <p>High-Purpose Cultures are not random, they are deliberate. Culture Science® is a methodology that provides the mental models and frameworks that allow organizations to solve their toughest human-centered challenges while also creating positive, productive cultures that deliver business outcomes at scale.</p>
        <p>Culture Science® is based upon Culture Science, an anti-disciplinary approach to change based on Social and Behavioral Sciences, Neuroscience, and Management Science. Culture Science is the foundation of Gapingvoid’s End-to-End Culture Design.</p>

    <h1>Design a High-Purpose Culture</h1>
    <p>High-Purpose Culture™ is designed based on a new model we developed with BJ Fogg at Stanford Behavior Design Lab. High Purpose Cultures are rooted in two main factors:</p>
    <p>Future Motivated State. As a leader, you must answer the question: Why should each employee and stakeholder be excited about showing up each day? What is your motivating North Star?</p>
    <p>Articulated Beliefs. A collection of beliefs, mindsets, values, mental models, and other factors that, when taken together, inform how people should be doing their work.</p>
    <p>This model has been successfully executed at scale in scores of organizations of different sizes across many industries.</p>
